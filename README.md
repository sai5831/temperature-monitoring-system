##description##

Temperature monitoring systems are widely used in industrial, agricultural, and domestic environments to maintain optimal operating conditions and ensure safety. In this project, we develop a low-cost and accurate temperature monitoring system using an Arduino UNO and LM35 temperature sensor. The system reads the ambient temperature and displays the real-time data on a 16x2 LCD screen.
